Loading your data
Getting your data into Python using Spyder is the first step to doing something interesting with it. Click the link below to download a new dataset.

Download File

Place it in a folder (name the folder ‘data’) and change the file permissions of the dataset to read-only. The easiest way to achieve this is to find the document in your file management system, inspect its properties, and apply read-only.

Note: You can also do this through the terminal (in the console pane) using chmod 444 for Linux/Mac or similar commands for Windows. This is only recommended if you have prior experience working in the command line.

To load our file, in the console, type:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

VARNAME = pd.read_csv("data/FILENAME")
If you have problems with getting file paths to work, you can use:

python
Copy code
from tkinter import filedialog

file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()
VARNAME = pd.read_csv(file_path)
This function should open a file explorer window where you can select the file you want to open, and it will return you the file path. What format and size your data comes in will dictate how best to process and store it.

This is a simple introduction to getting your data into Python using Spyder. In some cases, there will be significant complications (e.g., many files, large data size, unusual file format, etc.). In cases like this, Python libraries such as pandas have tools to help.
