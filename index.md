This is a condensed introduction to Python and Spyder. We have aimed to provide you with the basic information you need to tackle statistics and machine learning. It is a big task to learn a programming language especially if you have no experience. You will not be fluent in Python by the end of this session, but hopefully you will be off to a good start.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Navigate Spyder, install packages, and manage projects.
* Handle variables and data structures (arrays, lists, and data frames).
* Impliment flow control.
* Create functions.
* Plot graphics.

> ## Prerequisites
